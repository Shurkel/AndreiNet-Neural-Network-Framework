Alex: Hey, what are you up to this weekend?

Jordan: Not sure yet. I was thinking about finally starting that show everyone keeps talking about.

Alex: Oh, you mean "The Galactic Heist"? It’s soooo good. You’re gonna get hooked.

Jordan: That’s what I’m afraid of. I have this huge project to finish.

Alex: Pfft, procrastination is just time travel for your problems.

Jordan: Haha, yeah, but future me is really bad at handling that stuff.

Alex: Future you will be fine. Just balance it out — work a bit, watch a bit.

Jordan: True… or I could binge the whole thing first, then panic.

Alex: Classic. I support this plan.
